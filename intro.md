It doesn’t matter how beautiful your theory is.\
It doesn’t matter how smart you are.\
If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it is wrong.

There are several reasons physicists carry out experiments: to develop new knowledge, like the discovery and usage of radioactivity; to test hypotheses and theories, think of the discovery and proof of Majorana particles some 75 years after the prediction of its existence; and to explore and determine features of various systems.

One cannot simply carry out an experiment and call it a scientific experiment. There are many scientific rules that must be adhered to. One must put a lot of work and effort into the experiment and in writing the report before others (peers, other experts in the field) can be convinced that what was found is reliable and valid. Doing the work thoroughly will also help to make sure that the values of quantities can be determined accurately.

The goal of the course "Introduction to Experimentation" is to give you a first glimpse of what it means to do experiments in physics, and to demonstrate the rules that must be applied when doing such experiments. You will work with equipment that is often used by physicists in labs. You will learn how to collect, process, analyse and present experimental data. Explicitly, after following this course you are able to:

* understand what is required before you can start collecting data in a scientific, physics experiment
* collect, analyse and present empirical data for the purpose of scientific research
* write a concise report on a physics experiment

Rather than using extensive lectures, we provide all necessary information in this manual and make use of short movie clips in each of the chapters (click the movie symbol). This allows more freedom and do not require you to participate in aspects in lectures where the content is already familiar to you. However, if you require more help or additional information, do not hesitate to contact the teacher or any of the TA's.

This course has been redesigned recently. If you have ideas for improvement, let us know! If you have additional questions or comments, the coordinator of the course, Freek Pols, is available every Friday morning from 9:00h to 12:00h in room A005.

I hope you will enjoy the physical experiments we have designed for you.
