```{admonition}  I am not able to attend, e.g., illness..
:class: dropdown

If it is absolutely impossible to come in person (such as in the case of illness), you must report this inability before 08:30 if the mandatory part is scheduled for the morning on that day. If the mandatory part is scheduled for the afternoon, you must cancel by telephone (015-2785886 or 015-2786552) or by e-mail (adminnp-tnw@tudelft.nl) before 13:00. Read more [here](#rules_attendance).

```{admonition}  I do not agree with my report grade.
:class: dropdown

Our teaching-assistants are all very competent and experienced. However, in case of any disagreement, contact the coordinator. The coordinator will assign a second TA to check the grading. We want to state that in previous cases, the second TA always agreed with the first, with a max difference of 0.3 / 10 in grade!
```

```{admonition}  My grade is insufficient?
:class: dropdown

If your grade for the second experiment is lower than a 5.5, you will be allowed to hand in a second version. The grade for this second version will not be higher than a 6.0, but in some cases that will be enough to allow you to pass the course.
