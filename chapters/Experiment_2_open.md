# Experiment 2E: An open inquiry
In this open experiment, you use the equipment of the first experiment and pose your own research question that can be answered using this setup. To do so, you first have to write a small proposal which is assessed (GO/NO GO).

## Proposal
Note: This proposal format is adopted from the VICI scheme, NWO.

**Title of research proposal:** Give the title of your research proposal.

**Scientific summary of research proposal:** Provide a scientific summary of your proposal (topic, approach and potential importance of the results) in no more than 300 words. Make sure to provide an informative and relevant abstract. The abstract should clearly describe what you are going to investigate, why you are going to investigate this subject and which results you expect to find.

**Description of the proposed research:** Describe the proposed research as accurately as you can within the stated maximum number of words and pages. The maximum is 1,200 words on no more than three pages. The word count includes all text, including in-text references, footnotes, figure captions and tables.

## Examples
To help you getting inspirations for research questions, a few examples are given below:

- **What is the quality factor of the pendulum?** How much energy is lost in each period of the pendulum?
- **Hoe does the period depend on the angle to the vertical?**
- **What is the best model to completely describe the behaviour of the pendulum?**
- **What is the $C_w$ value of a ping-pong ball?** The air resistance is given by $F_w = \frac{1}{2}\rho C_w (Re) A_\perp v^2$
- **When does the ping-pong ball reach its terminal velocity?** And what is the corresponding equation of motion?
- **What are the similarities and differences between a simulation and observed movements of a bouncing ping-pong ball?**
- **Determine the inertia of the rope-ball combination.**
- **How much energy is dissipated upon collision with the ground?** What is the coefficient of restitution?
