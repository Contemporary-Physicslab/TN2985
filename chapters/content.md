# Course content & Final grade

The course consist of an introduction to **measurement and uncertainty** combined with an introduction to **Python** and **two experiments**. For each experiment, you will write a paper. You are allowed to work together, however, your partner for the second experiment should be different from the person you worked with during the first experiment. This is due to the fact that an important aspect of the minor is that you will meet new people with different (educational) backgrounds. We want to stimulate this by forming new teams.

The final grade for the course is calculated by:

$$
    \text{Grade} = 0.2 \cdot \text{M\&U} + 0.4 \cdot \text{IE$_1$} + 0.4 \cdot \text{IE$_2$}
$$ (eq:grade)

If your grade for IE$_2$ is lower than a 5.5, you will be allowed to hand in a second version. The grade for this second version will not be higher than a 6.0, but in some cases that will be enough to allow you to pass the course.

| What | How | Teamwork | Percentage |
| ---- | --- | -------- | ---------- |
| M\&U | online test | individual | 20\% |
| IE$_1$ | paper | student pair | 40\% |
| IE$_2$ | paper | student pair | 40\% | 

### Measurement and uncertainty
Measurement and uncertainty is a chapter in this manual which you will have to read. There will be a number of exercises, some of which will involve the use of Python. These exercises will prepare you for the test. There is an afternoon scheduled where a TA is available for help if you have questions about measurement and uncertainty and the use of Python. However, you are allowed to work at home and consult the TA using MS Teams.

Your knowledge of measurement and uncertainty will be assessed in an online test using Jupyter Notebooks. You are allowed to bring this manual, premade scripts, notes etc. ,in other words, it is an open book exam. You are not allowed to consult others during the online test.

### Experiment 1
The first experiment is the same for everyone and involves determining the gravitational acceleration $g$ within 0.5\%. You and your lab-partner ought to determine the fourth significant number of the gravitational acceleration. This experiment will help you get acquainted with experiments in physics. During two pre-scheduled afternoons you will work on a scientific paper using the RevTex-template. You are allowed to work at home, but it is mandatory to at least show a draft version. This will help you to adjust major mistakes. Such a paper is different in many elements from reports in other engineering subjects. The paper will be assessed.

### Experiment 2
The second experiment will be done pairwise. There are several experiments (different experiments each year) of which one is to be chosen. You should enroll yourselves at BrightSpace for the preferred experiment. Note that we have only a limited number of equipment available and some of the groups will be quickly filled. 

Please prepare the experiments for which you enrolled. This saves valuable time during the scheduled hours. Preparation means that you read the chapter, carry out the assignments and start working on labjournal.

**Determining the half-life of K-40**

Two different methods are used to determine the half-life of K-40. The literature value is used to determine which method yields the best value. However, one should consider the trade offs as well!

**Spectral lines of Sodium or Mercury**

Spectral lines can be determined to identify atoms and molecules of distant stars. In this experiment you will determine the spectral lines of Sodium or Mercury using spectroscopy.

**Boltzmann**

This experiment consist of two parts. You will determine the Boltzmann constant by characterizing the ($V,I$)-behavior of a silicium diode by a constant temperature. In the second part you will focus on the behavior of the diode as function of temperature.

**Water droplet** 

In this experiment you will investigate two aspects of a water droplet: the size and shape of water droplet and the drag coefficient. 

**Surface tension**

In this experiment you will investigate the surface tension of water. You are free to either compare two different methods or investigate how a factor of interest (for instance temperature or sugar concentration) changes the surface tension.

**Millikan**

In this historic experiment you will determine the elementary charge by emerging charged oil droplets between two charged plates.

## Schedule and deadlines
When you enroll in the Introductory Laboratory Course you will receive a personal timetable. This timetable shows, amongst other things, the date of the lab safety test, the time and place of the experiments and the deadlines. If you fail the online safety test, you will not be allowed to take part in the rest of the course. 

The practical sessions cover the following topics: Python, IE$_1$, writing a lab report, and IE$_2$.
