# Characteristics of surface tension

## Goal
The goal of this experiment is to determine the surface tension of water and compare two methods of doing so, or determine the surface tension of water as function of its temperature or as function of a variable that you are interested in (for instance, concentration of sugar). 

## Preparation
Before you arrive at the practical, you are expected to have properly studied this chapter of the manual, and to have written down the answers to the questions that are noted in your lab journal. If any questions come up during your preparation, write them down in your journal and ask them at the beginning of the experiment. 

## Background
Surface tension is a well-known phenomenon. At least, we are all familiar with it. We are familiar with water striders on the water, water sticking to the side of a rain pipe, and so on. But the idea of surface tension is rather comprehensive, often only an approximation of the phenomenon due to the abrupt transition from liquid to gas is given. The main idea is that the potential energy of a molecule at the surface is higher than at other places in the liquid. This implies that energy is needed to add molecules. Therefore there is a force that 'resist' against surface expansion. Surface tension is also an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity, where liquid rises in a tube.

## Method
### The ring of Du Noüy
If we place a metal ring with a small diameter $d$ and radius $R$ at the surface, it may not sink. Conversely, if we try to take the ring out, it seems as if it is stuck to the surface. A first approximation of the force required to pull the ring out of the water is given by:

$$ F = 4 \pi R \sigma $$ (eq:surf)

$\sigma$ is here the surface tension. However, carefully looking at the ring we see that water sticks to the ring, meaning that a force is needed to pull the water up as well. Moreover, there is a buoyancy force acting on the ring as well. Taking these factors into account leads to the equation:

$$
F = 4 \pi R \sigma - 2 \pi R d \sqrt{2 \sigma \rho g} + \frac{1}{4} \pi^2 R d^2 \rho g
$$

here $\rho$ is the density of the liquid, $g$ the acceleration due to gravity. All we ought to do is determine what force is required to pull the ring out of the water...

The surface tension is determined using the force tensiometer of Du Noüy, see {numref}`fig:nouy_opst`. This is a so called torsionbalance in which a thin balance arm (8) is attached to the horizontally tensioned torison wire (7). The platina ring is attached at the end of the arm (6). The required force is determined by:
1. balancing the arm by adjusting knob 1 so that the thin arm is horizontally level. One uses thereto the occulair, see {numref}`fig:nouy_opst`. 
1. submerging the ring by adjusting the height of the can using knob 5. 
1. balance the arm by carefully turning knob 1 and 5
1. if the arm is balanced, lower the can a little using knob 5, balance the arm again using knob 1 and continue until the ring 'jumps' out of the water

To determine the force acting on the ring, we can use the torsion scale, which needs to be calibrated first. To do that, several weights are available. 

### Capillary rise

A capillary (see {numref}`fig:capmethod`) with inner radius $r$ is put in a liquid. The liquid moistens the inner tube and the liquid rises to a height $h$. The following equation holds:

$$
2\pi r \gamma = \pi r^2 h \rho g
$$

Here, $\rho$ is the density of the liquid and $g$ is the gravitational constant. Verify this formula.

The capillary rise height $h$ is measured with a microscope (see {numref}`fig:capmethod`. First, focus the scope on the surface of the water in the tray and note the height of the scope. Consequently, focus the scope on the top of the liquid in the capillary and note the height again. The difference between the noted heights is the capillary rise height $h$.

## Experimental approach

1. Start with a trial run to get a feel for both measurements.

1. Firstly, clean the water tray of the tensiometer thoroughly with tap water; fill it and clean the surface by throwing out small amounts of water with small jerks to the tray. Why is this done?

    After that, dry the bottom of the tray with a piece of cloth. Measure the temperature and determine the surface tension with the tensiometer. Repeat the measurements with warm water. Let your observations be checked by the assistant.

1. After your final measurement, contaminate the water by touching it with your finger. Measure the surface tension again.

1. Measure the capillary rise height and the room temperature.

1. Consider what research question you would like to answer. Devise a method for the experiment so that your research question can be answered. Have your method checked by the supervisor and carry out the experiment.
