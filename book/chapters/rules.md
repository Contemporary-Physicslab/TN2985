# Rules and regulations
This introductory laboratory course provides you with your first experience in conducting physics experiments. This includes taking measurements, processing them, and recording the results in a short paper.

## Course content & Final grade
The course consist of an introduction to **measurement and uncertainty** combined with an introduction to **Python** and **two experiments**. For each experiment, you will each write a paper. You are allowed to work together, however, your partner for the second experiment should be different from the person you worked with during the first experiment. This is due to the fact that an important aspect of the minor is that you will meet new people with different (educational) backgrounds. We want to stimulate this by forming new teams.

The final grade for the course is calculated by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:grade}
    Grade = 0.2 \cdot M\&U + 0.4 \cdot IE_1 + 0.4 \cdot IE_2
\end{equation}
If your grade for IE2 is lower than a 5.5, you will be allowed to hand in a second version. The grade for this second version will not be higher than a 6.0, but in some cases that will be enough to allow you to pass the course.

### Measurement and uncertainty
Measurement and uncertainty is a chapter in this manual which you will have to read. There will be a number of exercises, some of which will involve the use of Python. These exercises will prepare you for the test. There is an afternoon scheduled where a TA is available for help if you have questions about measurement and uncertainty and the use of Python. However, you are allowed to work at home and consult the TA using MS Teams.


Your knowledge of measurement and uncertainty will be assessed in an online test using Jupyter Notebooks. You are allowed to bring this manual, premade scripts, notes etc. In other words, it is an open book exam. You are not allowed to consult others during the online test.

### IE$_1$
The first experiment is the same for everyone and involves determining the gravitational acceleration $g$ within 0.5\%. You and your lab-partner ought to determine the fourth significant number of the gravitational acceleration. This experiment will help you get acquainted with experiments in physics. During two pre-scheduled afternoons you will work on a scientific paper using the RevTex-template. You are allowed to work at home, but it is mandatory to at least show a draft version. This will help you to adjust major mistakes. Such a paper is different in many elements from reports in other engineering subjects. The paper will be assessed.

### IE$_2$}
The second experiment will be done pairwise. There are five experiments in total of which one is to be chosen. You should enroll yourselves at BrightSpace for the preferred experiment. Note that we have only a limited number of equipment available and some of the groups will be quickly filled. 


Please prepare the experiments for which you enrolled. This saves valuable time during the scheduled hours. Preparation means that you read the chapter, carry out the assignments and start working on labjournal.


**IE-2$_a$: Determining the half-life of K-40**

Two different methods are used to determine the half-life of K-40. The literature value is used to determine which method yields the best value. However, one should consider the trade offs as well!


**IE-2$_b$: Spectral lines of Sodium or Mercury**

Spectral lines can be determined to identify atoms and molecules of distant stars. In this experiment you will determine the spectral lines of Sodium or Mercury using spectroscopy.


**IE-2$_c$: Boltzmann constant and electronic instruments**

This experiment consist of two parts. You will determine the characteristics of a low pass filter and subsequently determine the Boltzmann constant (or visa versa). In the first part of the experiment you will use an oscilloscope and in the second part a digital multi meter. The experiments focus on using accurate instruments often used in physics labs (not allowed for students with a background in electronics).


**IE-2$_d$: Waterdroplet** 

In this experiment you will investigate two aspects of a waterdroplet: the size and shape of waterdroplet and the drag coefficient. 


**IE-2$_e$: Surface tension**

In this experiment you will investigate the surface tension of water. You are free to either compare two different methods or investigate how a factor of interest (for instance temperature or sugar concentration) changes the surface tension.


## Schedule and deadlines
When you enroll in the Introductory Laboratory Course you will receive a personal timetable. This timetable shows, amongst other things, the date of the lab safety test, the time and place of the experiments and the deadlines. If you fail the online safety test, you will not be allowed to take part in the rest of the course. 


The practical sessions in the IE block cover the following topics: Python, IE-1, writing a lab report, and IE-2.

## Rules of attendance
To ensure that all students can complete the Introductory Laboratory Course in time, it is essential that everybody does what is asked of them. This has proved difficult for some students. This has forced us to make use of a penalty system. When penalties are imposed, they can have serious consequences: they could result in you failing the course and therefore failing the entire minor. (Below, the sanctions are indicated in italics.) For this reason, we strongly advise you to take note of the penalties for infractions like late arrival and do all you can to avoid them.

### Illness, etc.
As stated earlier, the smooth running of the Introductory Laboratory Course relies upon your attending the sessions listed in your personal timetable. If you realize in advance that you will be absolutely unable upon your attending a particular session, contact the course office as soon as possible to try to arrange an alternative time and date. This is always subject to the availability of places, and you must have a legitimate reason for rescheduling (a holiday, for instance, is not acceptable).


By notifying us promptly, you may also enable the course office to reallocate your place to another student in a similar situation.


If you find yourself unable to attend at the last minute – due to illness, for example – you must inform the course office no later than 8.30am on the day of a missed morning session and no later than 1.30pm on the day of a missed afternoon session. To notify us, call 015 278 5886 or 015 278 2459 or e-mail adminnp-tnw@tudelft.nl.


You will need to arrange an alternative time and date as soon as possible. If you fail to do so, you will not be able to continue the course.


You can cancel and reschedule attendance at lab sessions up to three times. If you try to do so a fourth time, you are considered to have fallen so far behind that you will be unable to pass the course in the current academic year and so are excluded from it.

### Absences without notification
If you fail to attend a lab session or experiment without giving advance notice or informing us on time with a valid reason, you must report in person to the course office as soon as possible to arrange a new time and date.


In this case, one full point is deducted from your final grade for the course. Only one unannounced absence of this kind is permitted; if it happens a second time, you will be excluded from the course. 

### Lateness
Lab sessions begin promptly at either 8.45am or 1.45pm.
1.	If you arrive less than 15 minutes late, you are permitted to join the session.
2.	If you arrive more than 15 minutes late, you will not be permitted to the session and must report in person to the course office as soon as possible to arrange a new time and date. This due to safety issues and instructions that are necessary to know how instruments work and what is expected of you during the experiments.


The worst case scenario is that a full point is deducted from that specific experiment. Whether this penalty is applied, will be discussed with the practical coordinator.

## Handing in your work
The course includes a number of assignments, in the form of lab concise papers of the experiments you have conducted, that need to be handed in. As stated, you are allowed to work in pairs but have to switch partner for the second experiment.


Your paper must be handed in using Brightspace, where it is grade using a rubric. This will be scanned for plagiarism using TurnItIn. You ought to submit your digital lab notebook using Vocareum.


The deadlines for submitting both versions (and, if required, improved rewrites) are set by the course administrators. In exceptional circumstances, you may be granted an extension of up to one week; to obtain one, you must apply at least one day before the original deadline and in person or by e-mail (not by telephone), with valid reasons.


If your second lab paper is not good enough, you will be asked to submit an improved rewrite by a new deadline. In this case, you must also provide the original version again. Without that, your revised paper will not be assessed.


If you fail to hand in and upload a paper on time, it will be marked 1 out of 10. Once you have missed the deadline, there is no point in submitting the paper at all as it will not be assessed anyway. 

### Fraud and plagiarism
To check that you have not copied somebody else’s work, or parts of it, your paper is scanned for plagiarism. If one or more passages are found to be identical to another paper, that is treated as fraud and the Board of Examiners is informed. The board has the power to impose very severe penalties, not least excluding you from the course.

## Software
You need to install [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc). Furthermore, you will use LaTeX. A simple way to use LaTeX is using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
