# Home experiment 2
In many kids toys physics is involved. Think about a small  [*Pull-Back Toy Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdvfiVebb_s)* that you move a little backwards and when released rushes away, moving a few meters. Many websites of the [*physics of toys](https://www.livescience.com/33614-the-cool-physics-of-7-toys.html)* can be found.


In this second home experiment you can pose your own research question, do an experiment, answer the question and publish your findings. So team up (three students), find a subject of interest (pull-Back Toy Car / Slinky / Bouncing balls / Whatever-you-think-of), pose a research question you'd like to answer. Present your ideas and discuss with the teacher. If you get a GO, carry out the experiment(s) and proceed in the regular way.


The level of physics involved is not very important. I am mostly interested how you carry out the experiment so it can be called *scientific*.
